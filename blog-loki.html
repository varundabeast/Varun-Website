                        <h1>My Opinions and Thoughts on LOKI, Marvel's Newest TV Show</h1>
                        <p>
                            Following the realease of two fantastic shows, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Wandavision, comes Loki, the famous Marvel Villain star of his own show. With this new release coming in, Marvel Fans certainly have a high bar as the two shows released after Endgame were massive hits. Seeing the teasers that were put out of the content that Marvel was going to release I was most excited about LOKI and the upcoming Shang-Chi. Fast foward a couple months and we are already 3 episodes into the LOKI show and eagerly awaiting another episode this Wednesday. The show takes place during Endgame in fact, because during the Time Heist, Loki came into contact with the Space Stone that teleported him to a desert and out of the proper flow of time. From there, we meet the Time Variance Authority which is a group that is in charge of keeping the natural flow of time by catching people like Loki who create other timelines. These people are called variants. Loki being Loki things he is way above all this and tries to employ his "godly" powers to show the people at the TVA that he is boss. This however backfires and Loki ends up learning that the TVA is one of the greatest powers in the multiverse. Created by the Time Keepers who focused their energy into creating a single sacred timeline where they dictate how events occur and play out. This sacred timeline was created to stop the time wars where different timelines fought and chaos reigned. Loki is astounded by this and tries to seek and audience with the almighty Time Keepers. His supervisor, Mobius thinks he can use Loki to help him catch a very dangerous variant who is also just Loki from another timeline branch. Although many other events have happened since that point I feel like that is a good summary to briefly explain a major part of Loki.

                            <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
                            <p>
                            Being a Marvel show I was sure I was going to like it off the bat. Being a huge fan of Tom Hiddleston I was ensured I would get my fair share of good acting. The plot and the story came as a huge surprise and I was excited that Marvel would change things up a bit rather than focusing on the stones for 23 movies. The characters thus far have also entertained me with the entrance of Owen Wilson coming as Mobius and Sylvie a girl version of Loki bent on destroying the Time-Keepers. As I keep watching the events play out I keep thinking to myself how powerful the TVA actually is and how they can incorporate so many charcaters into the fray just by using this concept. On the other hand, there are a few things that I did not fancy so much about the LOKI TV show. To elaborate, I felt the entire episode 3 was an insignificant event as the only thing I learned was a little but about Sylvie which they could have done in a much faster manor. However, Episode 3 was still entertaining and I enjoyed it none the less and that was jus a minor nitpick. All in all, I think the Loki show is famtastic and I love the plot and storyline Marvel wnet with this time. I can't wait for Wednesday to watch episode 4.
