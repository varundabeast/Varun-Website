                    My Name is Varun Ganti and I am a 7th Grader who loves Board Games, Travel, Sports, and Marvel Superheroes. I love to play board games in my free time with friends and family. My Collection includes 128 different board games and expansions. Some of my favorites are Unmatched, Gloomhaven, and Marvel Champions the  Card Game. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    I play these games a whole lot and is my number one free-time activity. In addition, I watch a lot of Sports and TV shows. The sports I watch are the NFL which is the National Football League and the IPL (Indian Premiere League). Usually when the the season starts for either of these leagues I am all in, and love to discuss the games with friends and family. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    On the other hand, I also love watching movies and TV shows related to pretty much anything to do with action, adventure, or mystery. My all time favorite movie series is the Marvel Infinity Saga as well as Transformers or Jurrasic Park. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    Superhero films or TV shows are my go to and I will pretty much watch anything related to that sort of topic. My favorite TV/Movie characters is The Green Arrow and Scarlet Witch who are both comic superheroes. To change the topic, my family loves to travel and we have visited many countries. To be more precise, we have gone to all the continents except for Antacrtica and have been to 45 countries. Our most recent internation trip was to Spain where we went to Barcelona and Valencia.
